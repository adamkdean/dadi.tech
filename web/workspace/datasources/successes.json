This has allowed for more targeted messaging which is more effective for both brand and users alike.\n\nThe DADI platform also manages editorial content across browser site and apps, while our solutions team has been working in co-development with engineers at Monocle offering support ranging from tech heavy lifting to UX and design – a partnership that has rewarded Monocle.com with several awards for its digital product.",
