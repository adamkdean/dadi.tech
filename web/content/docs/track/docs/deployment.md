# DADI Track

## Deployment

Make sure to properly secure the dashboard if you don't want outside people to see it. The dashboard's 'listen' function takes a second argument that is the interface to bind; typically you would choose "127.0.0.1" to only allow access from localhost, or "0.0.0.0" to listen on all interfaces.  You should then run the tracking pixel on a different port so that it is accessible to the outside world.
