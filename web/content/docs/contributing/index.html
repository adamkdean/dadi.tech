<p>We‚Äôre pashionate about Open Source software so participation on any level is encouraged üëØ. This document outlines how to contribute on any level.</p>

<h2 id="developer-documentation">Developer documentation</h2>

<p>Work is currently underway to ensure all DADI products have sufficient developer documentation.</p>

<p>We are using <a href="http://usejsdoc.org/">JSDoc</a> to parse inline code comments and generate more useful documentation.</p>

<p>Please add comments to code where possible, following the guidelines at http://usejsdoc.org</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>/**
 * Represents a book.
 * @constructor
 * @param {string} title - The title of the book.
 * @param {string} author - The author of the book.
 */
function Book(title, author) {

}
</code></pre>
</div>

<h2 id="unit-tests">Unit Tests</h2>

<p>All products should have a set of unit and/or acceptance tests in a <code class="highlighter-rouge">test</code> folder at the root of the repository.</p>

<p>We use <code class="highlighter-rouge">mocha</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">should.js</code> as our testing libraries. See existing tests for guidance.</p>

<p>Be sure to provide instructions in the README for running tests.</p>

<h2 id="bugs">Bugs</h2>

<h3 id="bug-reporting">Bug reporting</h3>

<p>All bugs should be raised as issues with the label <code class="highlighter-rouge">Bug</code>. Unless you are going to tackle the bug yourself, please refrain from assigning it. The core engineering team at DADI will handle it.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Before you submit a new issue</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Please ensure your new issue conforms to NPM‚Äôs <a href="https://github.com/npm/npm/wiki/Contributing-Guidelines">Contributing   Guidelines</a>. Because they‚Äôre pretty sensible.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="bug-fixes">Bug Fixes</h3>

<p>Create a <code class="highlighter-rouge">fix</code> branch off <code class="highlighter-rouge">master</code>. If you‚Äôre fixing a raised issue please include the issue number in the branch name:</p>

<div class="language-sh highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="gp">$ </span>git checkout master
<span class="gp">$ </span>git pull origin master
<span class="gp">$ </span>git checkout -b fix/132-short-issue-description
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>When you‚Äôve finished developing, create a pull request. Your <code class="highlighter-rouge">fix</code> branch will be merged into <code class="highlighter-rouge">master</code>.</p>

<h2 id="new-features">New Features</h2>

<h3 id="feature-requests">Feature requests</h3>

<p>All feature requests should be raised as issues with the label <code class="highlighter-rouge">Feature request</code>. Unless you are going to tackle the feature request yourself, please refrain from assigning it. The core engineering team at DADI will handle it.</p>

<h3 id="feature-development">Feature development</h3>

<p>Create a <code class="highlighter-rouge">feature</code> branch off <code class="highlighter-rouge">master</code>.  If you‚Äôre implementing a raised issue please include the issue number in the branch name:</p>

<div class="language-sh highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="gp">$ </span>git checkout master
<span class="gp">$ </span>git pull origin master
<span class="gp">$ </span>git checkout -b feature/007-my-new-feature
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>When you‚Äôve finished developing, create a pull request. Your <code class="highlighter-rouge">feature</code> branch will be merged into <code class="highlighter-rouge">master</code>.</p>

<h2 id="releases">Releases</h2>

<p>When we decide to release new version <code class="highlighter-rouge">vN.0.0</code>, the following steps are followed:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Create a new branch off master named after the release version: <code class="highlighter-rouge">vN.0.0</code></li>
</ol>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">sh
  $ git checkout master
  $ git pull origin master
  $ git checkout -b vN.0.0
 </code></p>

<ol>
  <li>Tag the HEAD revision as a release candidate with <code class="highlighter-rouge">vN.0.0-rc.1</code></li>
</ol>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">sh
  $ git tag -a vN.0.0-rc.1 -m "Version N.0.0 RC 1"
 </code></p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Test thoroughly</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If testing reveals some more work is required, push commits to the <code class="highlighter-rouge">vN.0.0</code> branch.<br />
  When all fixes are in, create a new <code class="highlighter-rouge">vN.0.0-rc.x</code> tag</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>```sh
$ git tag -a vN.0.0-rc.x -m "Version N.0.0 RC x"
```
</code></pre>
</div>

<ol>
  <li>If all tests pass and the release is considered ready, we tag it <code class="highlighter-rouge">vN.0.0</code> and merge it back to master</li>
</ol>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>```sh
$ git tag -a vN.0.0 -m "Version N.0.0"
$ git checkout vN.0.0
$ git rebase master
$ git checkout master
$ git merge vN.0.0
```
</code></pre>
</div>

<h2 id="commits">Commits</h2>

<h3 id="one-change-per-commit">One change per commit</h3>

<p>A commit should contain exactly one logical change. A logical change includes adding a new feature, fixing a specific bug, etc. If it‚Äôs not possible to describe the high level change in a few words, it is most likely too complex for a single commit. The diff itself should be as concise as reasonably possibly and it‚Äôs almost always better to err on the side of too many patches than too few. As a rule of thumb, given only the commit message, another developer should be able to implement the same patch in a reasonable amount of time.</p>

<p>Please don‚Äôt include more than one change in each patch. If your commit message requires an ‚Äúand‚Äù in the middle, it‚Äôs likely you need separate commits.</p>

<h3 id="commit-messages">Commit messages</h3>

<p>Please use a short one-line summary of the change. After the one-line summary, an empty line, then multiple paragraphs explaining the patch in detail (if required). Don‚Äôt describe the code, describe the intent and the approach.</p>

<p>Please don‚Äôt add lazy commit messages such as ‚Äúmisc fixes and cleanups‚Äù.</p>
