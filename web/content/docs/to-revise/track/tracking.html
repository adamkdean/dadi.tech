<p>The file <code class="highlighter-rouge">client/sebright.js</code> contains a small script to trigger a Sebright event.  You can either paste the contents of the file into the body of your webpage or you can upload it to your server as a .js file and reference it with a <code class="highlighter-rouge">&lt;script&gt;</code> tag.  Once you have done so, in the footer of your page you can call -</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>SebrightTracker.track();
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Called with no arguments, it will send over some standard parameters such as the page URL.  You can also pass arbitrary data with the event -</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>SebrightTracker.track({logged_in: true});
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>The data can be used within Sebrightâ€™s metrics to filter events on the backend.</p>
