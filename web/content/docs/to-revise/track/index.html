<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

<p>DADI Track is a real time data visualisation layer built around the concept of events. It makes use of Nodeâ€™s non-blocking architecture to present a 1:1 view of tracked activity within a platform.</p>

<p>Events can be sent to DADI Track from a client device or from within the Bantam stack.</p>

<p>DADI Track is deliberately lightweight: it is not intended as a long term data storage solution or as a replacement to existing tracking tools such as Google Analytics or the wider DADI+ platform; rather it is designed to facilitate real time data dash boarding.</p>
