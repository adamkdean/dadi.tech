<p>Sebright is organized into two parts: a node.js-based tracking server that records user activity via a tracking pixel, and a collection of javascript-based widgets that display that activity.  The server broadcasts all activity to the clients using Websockets if possible, and falls back to Flash sockets or long polling if necessary.</p>

<p>The Sebright.WebSocket object receives websocket events from the server in the form of JSON objects.  Individual widgets subscribe to a metric and register handler functions to be called whenever that metric is present.</p>
