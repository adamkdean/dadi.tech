<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

<p>DADI Identity is a session-based platform that provides and gaurentees the fact of an individual, issuing and persisting UUIDs over multiple product-level sessions, over long durations of time and across multiple products (it is a multi-tenancy application).</p>

<p>DADI Identity is only interested in the fact of an individual. It does not track interactions or otherwise make use of the UUIDs generated.</p>

<p>It works exclusively in the anonymous space and does not handle personally identifiable information.</p>

<p>DADI Identity is designed to work in tandem with other products, both from DADI and third parties. The UUIDs produced can be used to synchronise data from the anonymous space; to create and maintain user records from the point of first contact; to carry anonymous user data over to the known space when paired with a Single Sign On service; to facilitate programmatic advertising and to provide and enhance analytics.</p>
