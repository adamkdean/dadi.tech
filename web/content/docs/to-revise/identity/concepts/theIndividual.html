<p>DADI Identity is a session-based platform that issues and persists UUIDs over multiple product-level sessions and over a long duration of time (our standard persistence window is six months). It is also capable of persisting UUIDs over multiple products.</p>

<p>DADI Identity is only interested in the fact of an individual. It does not track interactions or otherwise make use of the UUIDs generated.</p>

<p>DADI Identity works exclusively in the anonymous space. It does not handle personally identifable information.</p>

<p>It is designed to work in tandom with other products, both from DADI and third parties. The UUIDs produced can be used to synchonise data form the anonymous space; to create and maintain user records from the point of first contact; and to carry anonymous user data over to the known space when paired with a Single Sign On service.</p>

<p>Issued UUIDs are always unique: a gauretee is proivded through through the us of <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4122">RFC 4122 v4</a> along with a shared Redis layer in clustered environments.</p>

<p>For a probability asessment of collisions in issued UUIDs, see the <a href="LINK">collision probably</a> document.</p>

<p>For a breakdown of our RFC 4122 v4 generator, see the <a href="LINK">UUID generation</a> document.</p>

<p>DADI Identity <em>issues forwards</em>, meaning that if there is any doubt as to the fact of an individual, we simply issue a new UUID. When this happens, any previous match with a confidence score below 100% - in practice this means all previous matches - is linked as a child along with the confidence metric. This approach allows for the interrogation of a deeper data set in those cases where a UUID is not persisted over term, although our confidence in this data will be lower.</p>
