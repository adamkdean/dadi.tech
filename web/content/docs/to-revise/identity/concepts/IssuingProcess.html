<p>DADI Identity issues-forward, meaning that a new UUID is provided whenever a request hits the issuing layer within the application.</p>

<p>A request for a UUID is made if local lookups for an existing UUID return false within the requesting browser of app.</p>

<p>Requests for a UUID are made using a device-level fingerprint. This fingerprint is stored in the UUID record, but is not used as part of the issuing process.</p>

<p>DADI Identity responds to UUID requests with a persistant ETag, meaning that a previously issued UUID will be cached in the device. In this eventuality, no new UUID is generated.</p>

<p>If a request for a UUID has not been prviously cached, a new UUID will be generated and a record for the UUID created within Redis.</p>
