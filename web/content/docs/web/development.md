### Roadmap

We will capture planned updates and additions here. If you have anything to contribute in terms of future direction, please add as an enhancement request within [issues](https://github.com/dadi/web/issues).


### Versioning

Semantic Versioning 2.0.0

Given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, increment the:

* MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes,
* MINOR version when you add functionality in a backwards-compatible manner, and
* PATCH version when you make backwards-compatible bug fixes.

_Additional labels for pre-release and build metadata are available as extensions to the MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH format._
